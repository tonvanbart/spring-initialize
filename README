This is a proof-of-concept project which shows a Spring ApplicationContextInitializer which:

- switches certain Spring profiles on
- scans the context for beans which indicate that they want to be configured, and calls annotated methods passing in
  values from the configuration. The annotation also allows the specification of a default value in case the indicated
  key is not present.

This simple example just uses a Properties file for the configuration values, in production code this could be an
instance of, for example, Commons Configuration. The concept remains the same.
